Hello World!
<p>
This is a literate pseudo-Haskell program with some type declarations that are
(simplified versions) from my library.  It should be readable even without
Haskell familiarity.
</p>

<p>
I am working on a new event-driven user interface system.  I call it "Lift" for now.
</p>
{% highlight haskell %}
module Lift where
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
The fundamental objects are state-machines, which I will often refer to as
"objects" or sometimes as "games", and maps between them.  An interface is
defined by a collection of object types and map types, and instantiated with
real JS objects compiled from the definitions described below.
</p>

<p>
The most basic objects are finite state-machines, which are defined by a list
of state labels and nothing more:
{% highlight haskell %}
onoff :: ObjectType
onoff = Finite { states = ["on", "off"] }
{% endhighlight %}
</p>
<p>
Also needed are externally defined objects, like the objects that represent mouse and keyboard, and objects for rendering SVG and other DOM elements:
{% highlight haskell %}
mouse, keyboard, textElement :: ObjectType
mouse = External "Mouse"
keyboard = External "Keyboard"
textElement = External "TextElement"
{% endhighlight %}
They are defined elsewhere with pure JS code.
</p>
<p>
A fully general {%raw%}ObjectType{%endraw%} description consists of a name, a
list of object types describing the components of the state, and a collection
of labelled transitions that link states.  Transitions can be interpreted as
events that modify the state of an object.  An object inherits the transitions
from its component objects, so these are available to it as well.  
{% highlight haskell %}
type Name = String
type Label = String
type Field = String

-- The type for a transition
type Arrow = (PreCondition, PostCondition)

data ObjectType
 = ObjectType
 { name :: Name
 , fields :: [(Field, ObjectType)]
 , arrows :: [(Label, Arrow))]
 , maps :: [(Map, Field, Field)]
 }
 | Finite { states :: [Label] }
 | External { name :: Symbol }
 | Var { name :: Symbol } -- Read to the end for explanation...

-- Example object with finite state
switch :: ObjectType
switch =
 ObjectType
 { name = "switch"
 , fields = [("position", onoff)]
 , arrows = [("flip", (position = on  -> position = off)),
             ("flip", (position = off -> position = on))]
 }

{% endhighlight %}
<p>
We won't fully explain how pre- and post-conditions are written down.  The
"maps" component of ObjectType is optional and will be explained below.
</p>

<p>
A {%raw%}Map{%endraw%} has a source object and a target object.  It is required
to send each
transition of the source type to a transition of the target.  Maps can be
thought of as consistency relations that must be maintained between various
objects, or as things that propagate events between objects.  Whenever an
object goes through a transition, all maps out of it are triggered, and they
update their targets.
</p>
{% highlight haskell %}
-- Identifies a single arrow in the source object with one in the target
data ArrowMap = ((Label, Arrow), (Label, Arrow))
-- A collection of ArrowMaps from source to target
data Map 
 = Map
 { name :: Name
 , source :: ObjectType
 , target :: ObjectType
 , map :: [ArrowMap]
 }
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
The power of Lift comes from the way it represents dynamic relationships
between objects.  There is no global state; instead, the state of any given
element is determined by the maps defined into it and out of it, which are a
local property of the object.
</p>
<p>
Also, objects that consist of "diagrams" of other objects and maps can be
defined, and can be parametric.  For instance, we might have object types
called "point" and "box" to represent the notions of coordinate and bounding
box.  A graphical element to be rendered might be expected to possess a
coordinate and a box; by possess, we mean that it has maps out of it into point
and box.  This all can be abbreviated with a type:
{% highlight haskell %}
point, box, element :: ObjectType
point = ...
box = ...
element =
 ObjectType
 { name = "element"
 , fields = [("elem", Var "elemObj"),
             ("point", point)
             ("box", box)]
 , arrows = [] -- No additional arrows
 , maps [(Var "pointMap", "elem", "point"),
         (Var "boxMap",   "elem", "box")]
 }

{% endhighlight %}
This type is parametrized by an object and two maps as described in the
paragraph above.  The "Var" fields and maps denote these parameters.  Now, any
system that expects point and a box objects can be passed an element instead;
the internal "elem" field need never be directly examined, as it will be kept
in sync with "point" and "box" and the rest of the system through its internal
maps.
